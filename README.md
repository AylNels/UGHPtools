# UGHPtools
tools for data analysis under the UnderGraduate Heterosis Project

1. Phenotype data = data of plant growth
2. Genotype data= confirmation on plant genotype cross
3. UGHP data = merged data sets

*General Data Columns:
-SeedID = individual seed identifier (planting - geno_cross - parent_plant â€“ tray_in_planting)
-Geno_Cross = intended cross type

Phenotype: Plant growth data
Date= day measurement was taken from
Tray = tray plant was collected from
Total_Area.cm = area of roseatte in cm
Germ_date = date of germination
DAG = Days after germination



Genotype: Genotype confirmation data
X = number of row in excel
Directory = file name of HPLC on lab computer
Sample_Name = Plate sample was obtained from for HPLC
Plate_Position = Position on Plate (as given by computer)
X96_Well_Plate_1 = Plate o Inoculatoin
Position = Position on Plate
Isolate = Botrytis isolate type used
Flat= Name of Flat sample was collected from
QC = actual outcome of cross, according to HPLC
Note = outcome of cross (good or fail)
