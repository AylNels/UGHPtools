# UGHPtools
tools for data analysis under the UnderGraduate Heterosis Project

1. Phenotype data = data of plant growth
2. Genotype data= confirmation on plant genotype cross
3. UGHP data = Merge of above two data sets

####Shared Data Columns:
* SeedID = individual seed identifier (planting - geno_cross - parent_plant â€“ tray_in_planting)
* Geno_Cross = intended cross type
* Geno_Actual= actual cross type

####Phenotype: Plant growth data
* Date= day measurement was taken from
* Tray = tray plant was collected from
* Total_Area.cm = area of rosette in cm
* germ_date = date of germination
* DAG = Days after germination


####Genotype: Genotype confirmation data
* _X = number of row in excel_
* _Directory = file name of HPLC on lab computer_
* _Sample_Name = Plate sample was obtained from for HPLC_
* _Plate_Position = Position on Plate (as given by computer)_
* X96_Well_Plate_1 = Plate used Inoculation
* Position = Position on Plate
* Isolate = Botrytis isolate type used
* Flat= Name of Flat sample was collected from
* QC = actual outcome of cross, according to HPLC ~not yet determined in data sheets
* Note = outcome of cross (good or fail)

_italics = eliminated from UGHP cummulative data_
